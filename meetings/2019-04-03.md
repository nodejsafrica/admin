## Meeting Discussion
Agiri pointed out the need to change the current leadership group name from Node.js Board Members to Node.js Leadership Group, this is so that Board Membership rights could be properly assigned to the Community and Organization representative that may be interested in contributing to the growth of Node.js Africa. Which will also help in defining concrate roles for the team and volunteers alike, providing voting rights for decission making among the board.

Hassan suggested that evengalism for Node.js should be considered by identifying and reaching out to organizations and community that maybe interested in using Node.js or contributing to the Node.js Africa growth this will help in filling the Board Members proposed by Agiri, he also suggested an issue should be open to identify vacancies withing the organization where the community can volunteer to take up a particular responsibility for the organization.
